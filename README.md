# CruxProblem
## A simple project for the Artificial Intelligence
The exercise carried out aims at the CSP (Constraint Sati-sfaction Problem) modeling of the problem of the numerical crossword. 
For software implementation, particular attention is paid to programming languages for the success of constraints, in particular the Numberjack programming environment.
These languages are implemented directly and facilitated by an indefinite number of constraints, in order to provide a solution to the problem, net of a good modeling of it.

## Prerequisites
The implementation of the model to solve the crossword has been done with the programming language Python.
Once the model was set, the solver Mistral of the Numberjack library was used.
Requirement | Version Used
